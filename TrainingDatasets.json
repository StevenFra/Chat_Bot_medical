                "answer": "There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.   A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.  If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:  - Antidepressants  - Blood pressure medicines  - Seizure medicines    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.  Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium are right for you.  TREATING AN ATTACK  Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:   - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.  - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.  - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.    If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.   Feverfew is a herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your doctor approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs."

Causes of this problem include:   - The immune system attacking the thyroid gland  - Viral infections (common cold) or other respiratory infections  - Pregnancy (often called postpartum thyroiditis)    Other causes of hypothyroidism include:  - Certain medicines, such as lithium and amiodarone  - Congenital (birth) defects  - Radiation treatments to the neck or brain to treat different cancers  - Radioactive iodine used to treat an overactive thyroid gland  - Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland  - Sheehan syndrome, a condition that may occur in a woman who bleeds severely during pregnancy or childbirth and causes the destruction of the pituitary gland  - Pituitary tumor or pituitary surgery"

People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness). They also have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder. The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Researchers have identified two major types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: the complete form and the incomplete form. The types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause and by the results of a test called an electroretinogram, which measures the function of the retina.\n"

Dementia is the loss of mental functions severe enough to affect normal activities and relationships. Lewy body disease happens when abnormal structures, called Lewy bodies, build up in areas of the brain. The disease may cause a wide range of symptoms, including       - Changes in alertness and attention    - Hallucinations    - Problems with movement and posture    - Muscle stiffness    - Confusion    - Loss of memory       Lewy body disease can be hard to diagnose, because Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together.    Lewy body disease usually begins between the ages of 50 and 85. The disease gets worse over time. There is no cure. Treatment focuses on drugs to help symptoms.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"

Mutations in any of these three genes reduce or eliminate the function of the protein complex, preventing the normal breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, their accumulation leads to the serious health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease."

                "answer": "Lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. These changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.                  A type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. Anxiety tends to prolong insomnia.                  Several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. However, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible).                  Lifestyle Changes                  If you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as:                  Caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. The effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours.                  Certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). Talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep.                  Alcohol. An alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. However, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. This makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night.                  Try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. For example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath.                  Try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. Don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime.                  Make your bedroom sleep-friendly. Avoid bright lighting while winding down. Try to limit possible distractions, such as a TV, computer, or pet. Make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. Your bedroom also should be dark and quiet.                  Go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. If you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule.                  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy                  CBT for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. This therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety.                  For example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. These strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood.                  CBT also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. This method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time.                  CBT also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. This method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. The goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing.                  CBT also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. This method involves setting a sleep schedule. At first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep.                  This schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. However, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. Over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep.                  For success with CBT, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. CBT works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. It also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone.                  For people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, CBT combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions.                  Medicines                  Prescription Medicines                  Many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. Some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use.                  Talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. For example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them.                  Rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. If you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn't work well, tell your doctor. He or she might prescribe a different medicine.                  Some insomnia medicines can be habit forming. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines.                  Over-the-Counter Products                  Some over-the-counter (OTC) products claim to treat insomnia. These products include melatonin, L-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts.                  The Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate \u201cnatural\u201d products and some food supplements. Thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. How well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood.                  Some OTC products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. Although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them.                  Antihistamines pose risks for some people. Also, these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia. Your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you."

                "answer": "A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of tumor that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. The tumors are thought to grow from specialized cells found in the gastrointestinal tract called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or precursors to these cells. GISTs are usually found in adults between ages 40 and 70; rarely, children and young adults develop these tumors. The tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).  Small tumors may cause no signs or symptoms. However, some people with GISTs may experience pain or swelling in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or weight loss. Sometimes, tumors cause bleeding, which may lead to low red blood cell counts (anemia) and, consequently, weakness and tiredness. Bleeding into the intestinal tract may cause black and tarry stools, and bleeding into the throat or stomach may cause vomiting of blood.  Affected individuals with no family history of GIST typically have only one tumor (called a sporadic GIST). People with a family history of GISTs (called familial GISTs) often have multiple tumors and additional signs or symptoms, including noncancerous overgrowth (hyperplasia) of other cells in the gastrointestinal tract and patches of dark skin on various areas of the body. Some affected individuals have a skin condition called urticaria pigmentosa (also known as cutaneous mastocytosis), which is characterized by raised patches of brownish skin that sting or itch when touched."

People with this condition initially experience problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). Other early signs and symptoms of SCA3 include speech difficulties, uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), muscle stiffness (spasticity), rigidity, tremors, bulging eyes, and double vision. People with this condition may experience sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome or REM sleep behavior disorder. Restless leg syndrome is a condition characterized by numbness or tingling in the legs accompanied by an urge to move the legs to stop the sensations. REM sleep behavior disorder is a condition in which the muscles are active during the dream (REM) stage of sleep, so an affected person often acts out his or her dreams. These sleep disorders tend to leave affected individuals feeling tired during the day.  Over time, individuals with SCA3 may develop loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), muscle cramps, muscle twitches (fasciculations), and swallowing difficulties. Individuals with SCA3 may have problems with memory, planning, and problem solving.  Signs and symptoms of the disorder typically begin in mid-adulthood but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood. People with SCA3 eventually require wheelchair assistance. They usually survive 10 to 20 years after symptoms first appear."

                "answer": "There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.   A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.  If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:  - Antidepressants  - Blood pressure medicines  - Seizure medicines    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.  Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium are right for you.  TREATING AN ATTACK  Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:   - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.  - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.  - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.    If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.   Feverfew is a herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your doctor approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs."

Do\u00a0not try to treat\u00a0an ingrown nail\u00a0at home.  Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home:  - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry.  - Gently massage over the inflamed skin.  - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton with water or antiseptic.   When trimming your toenails:  - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nail.  - Use a clean, sharp trimmer.  - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short. Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse.   Consider wearing sandals until the problem\u00a0goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it\u00a0does not treat the problem.  If this does not work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist) or a skin specialist (dermatologist).  If your ingrown nail does not heal or keeps coming back, your doctor may remove part of the nail:  - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe.  - The doctor uses\u00a0scissors to cut along the edge of the nail where the skin is growing over. This portion of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion.  - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow.   Sometimes your doctor will use a chemical, electrical current, or another small surgical cut to destroy or remove the area from which a new nail may grow.  If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics."

ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also help decrease the amount of protein lost in the urine.  - Corticosteroids and other drugs that suppress or quiet the immune system.  - Treating high cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel problems. A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is usually not enough for people with nephrotic syndrome. Medicines to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides (usually statins) may be needed.  - A low-salt diet may help with swelling in the hands and legs. Water pills (diuretics) may also help with this problem.  - Low-protein diets may be helpful. Your health care provider may suggest a moderate-protein diet (1 gram [gm] of protein per kilogram [kg] of body weight per day).  - Taking\u00a0vitamin D supplements if nephrotic syndrome is long-term and is not responding to treatment.  - Taking blood thinner drugs to treat or prevent blood clots."

My question is this, she was in the ER for 12 hours before she was even seen by the general surgeon and then he wasn't convinced that it was this condition yet.  He said that he'd check on her in the morning once she was finally put into an ICU room (this was at 11 p.m.).  I last spoke to her at midnight that evening and that was the last time that she was conscious.  By the time she got to the ICU just 2-3 hours later, she was unresponsive and put on life support.  Surgery was eventually performed later that afternoon and 90% of her small intestine had to be removed.  She died early the next evening.  My question to you is did they wait too long to do anything for her?  Could she have been saved if surgery had been done sooner?  I'm possibly thinking of bringing on a lawsuit.....Please advise with any answers to my questions that you can give.  Thank you!",

With Cushing syndrome due to an adrenal tumor\u00a0or other tumors:  - You may need surgery to remove the tumor.  - If the tumor cannot be removed, you may need medicines to help block the release of cortisol."

                "answer": "Leber congenital amaurosis is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time.  Leber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all. Additionally, the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin, a condition known as keratoconus.  A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children.  In rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. However, researchers are uncertain whether these individuals actually have Leber congenital amaurosis or another syndrome with similar signs and symptoms.  At least 13 types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities."

Do NOT use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. Warts in these areas need to be treated by a health care provider.  To use wart-removal medicine:  - File the wart with a nail file or emery board when your skin is damp (for example, after a shower or bath). This helps remove dead tissue. Do not use the same emery board on your nails.  - Put the medicine on the wart every day for several weeks or months. Follow the instructions on the label.  - Cover the wart with a bandage to prevent it from spreading.\u00a0    OTHER TREATMENTS  Special foot cushions can help ease the pain from plantar warts. You can buy these at drugstores without a prescription. Use socks. Wear shoes with plenty of room. Avoid high heels.  Your health care provider may need to trim away thick skin or calluses that form over warts on your foot or around nails.   Your provider may recommend the following treatments if your warts do not go away:  - Stronger (prescription) medicines  - A blistering solution   - Freezing the wart (cryotherapy) to remove it  - Burning the wart (electrocautery) to remove it  - Laser treatment for difficult to remove warts  - Immunotherapy, which gives you a shot of a substance that causes an allergic reaction and helps the wart go away  - Skin medicine called imiquimod    Genital warts are treated in a different way than most other warts.

You could become blind.  - Your feet and skin could develop sores and infections. If you have these sores for too long, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching.  - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to the legs and feet.  - Nerves in the body can become damaged, causing pain, itching, tingling, and numbness.  - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can also make it harder for men to have an erection.  - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. The kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working, so that you would need dialysis or a kidney transplant."

This is done by a procedure called chelation -- certain medications can bind to copper and help remove it through the kidneys or gut. Treatment must be lifelong.  The following medications may be used:  - Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) binds to copper and leads to increased release of copper in the urine.  - Trientine (Syprine) binds (chelates) the copper and increases its release through the urine.  - Zinc acetate (Galzin) blocks copper from being absorbed in the intestinal tract.    Vitamin E supplements may also be used.  Sometimes, medications that chelate copper (especially penicillamine) can affect the function of the brain and nervous system (neurological function). Other medications under investigation may bind copper without affecting neurological function.  A low-copper diet may also be recommended. Foods to avoid include:  - Chocolate  - Dried fruit  - Liver  - Mushrooms  - Nuts  - Shellfish    You may want to drink distilled water because most tap water flows through copper pipes. Avoid using copper cooking utensils.  Symptoms may be treated with exercise or physical therapy. People who are confused or unable to care for themselves may need special protective measures.  A liver transplant may be considered in cases where the liver is severely damaged by the disease."

Other eye disorders, eye injuries, and birth defects can also cause vision loss. Whatever the cause, lost vision cannot be restored. It can, however, be managed. A loss of vision means that you may have to reorganize your life and learn new ways of doing things. If you have some vision, visual aids such as special glasses and large print books can make life easier. There are also devices to help those with no vision, like text-reading software and braille books. The sooner vision loss or eye disease is found and treated, the greater your chances of keeping your remaining vision. You should have regular comprehensive eye exams by an eye care professional."

After the foot is in the correct position, the child will wear a special brace nearly full time for 3 months. Then, the child will wear the brace at night and during naps for up to 3 years.  Often, the problem is a tightened Achilles tendon, and a simple procedure is needed to release it.  Some severe cases of clubfoot will\u00a0need surgery if other treatments do not work, or if the problem returns.

Without this protein, gangliosides, particularly ganglioside GM2, build up in cells, especially nerve cells in the brain.  Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a defective gene on chromosome 15. When both parents carry the defective Tay-Sachs gene, a child has a 25% chance of developing the disease. The child must receive two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, in order to become sick. If only one parent passes the defective gene to the child, the child is called a carrier. They will not be sick, but may pass the disease to their own children.  Anyone can be a carrier of Tay-Sachs. But, the disease is most common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population. 1 in every 27 members of the population carries the Tay-Sachs gene.  Tay-Sachs is divided into infantile, juvenile, and adult forms, depending on the symptoms and when they first appear. Most people with Tay-Sachs have the infantile form. In this form, the nerve damage usually begins while the baby is still in the womb. Symptoms usually appear when the child is 3 to 6 months old. The disease tends to get worse very quickly, and the child usually dies by age 4 or 5.  Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, which affects adults, is very rare."

But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months.   If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow.  Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis.   You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly.  Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible:  - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs.  - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together.  - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still.   Scoliosis treatment may also include:  - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace.  - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly."

Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:      Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke     Diabetes     High LDL cholesterol levels  Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:      Lower your blood pressure     Lower your blood sugar levels     Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke     Prevent inflammation  Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don\u2019t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis. Medical Procedures and Surgery  If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure that\u2019s used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.  Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.  Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.  Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke."

                "answer": "Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.  A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:   - Having sex at an early age  - Having multiple sexual partners  - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities    Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:  - Not getting the HPV vaccine  - Being economically disadvantaged  - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage  - Having a weakened immune system"

However, no specific diet can be recommended for IBS because the condition differs from one person to another.  The following changes may help:  - Avoiding foods and drinks that stimulate the intestines (such as caffeine, tea, or colas)  - Eating smaller meals  - Increasing fiber in the diet (this may improve constipation or diarrhea, but make bloating worse)    Talk with your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

                "answer": "Summary       Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.    Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.    Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

Choline is present in high amounts in: eggs, liver, kidney, peas, beans, peanuts, soy products, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. Trimethylamine N-oxide is present in seafood   Low doses of antibiotics. This decreases the amount of trimethylamine that is made by bacteria in the intestines   Laxatives can decrease the amount of time food remains in the intestines and therefore reduce the amount of trimethylamine made   Nutritional supplements (activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin) can decrease the concentration of trimethylamine in the urine Soaps with a moderate pH (between 5.5 and 6.5) can help remove the secreted trimethylamine from the skin Riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplements can enhance any existing FMO3 enzyme activity (which breaks down trimethylamine)   Avoidance of exercise, stress, emotional upsets, and other factors that can promote sweating People with trimethylaminuria may also find the following to be helpful:[1] Behavioral counseling to help with depression and other psychological symptoms Genetic counseling to better understand how they developed trimethylaminuria and the risks of passing the condition on to their children NOTE: People should follow the treatment advice of their healthcare provider and should not attempt to self-administer these treatment approaches. Medications and supplements can have unintended interactions, and dietary restrictions can result in nutritional deficits. Last updated: 1/24/2017"

Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center.

These are called topical treatments.  - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments.  - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis.    TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL)  Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include:  - Cortisone creams and ointments  - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin  - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid)  - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription)  - Moisturizers  - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids)    SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS  If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used.  Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include:  - Adalimumab (Humira)  - Etanercept (Enbrel)  - Infliximab (Remicade)  - Ustekinumab (Stelara)  - Secukinumab (Cosentyx)  - Apremilast (Otezla)    PHOTOTHERAPY  Some people may choose to have phototherapy:  - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light.  - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light.  - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.   OTHER TREATMENTS  If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics.  HOME CARE  Following these tips at home may help:   - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack.  - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup of oatmeal into a tub of warm water.  - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups.  - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned.  - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood.  - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse."

It can happen during both the day and night, although sleep-related bruxism is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control.  There is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench their teeth and never feel symptoms.   Factors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person. They may include:   -  How much stress you are under   -  How long and tightly you clench and grind   -  Whether your teeth are misaligned   -  Your posture   -  Your ability to relax   -  Your diet   -  Your sleeping habits"

If you have bruxism, you may unconsciously clench your teeth together during the day, or clench or grind them at night (sleep bruxism).  Sleep bruxism is considered a sleep-related movement disorder. People who clench or grind their teeth (brux) during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders, such as snoring and pauses in breathing (sleep apnea).  Mild bruxism may not require treatment. However, in some people, bruxism can be frequent and severe enough to lead to jaw disorders, headaches, damaged teeth and other problems.  Because you may have sleep bruxism and be unaware of it until complications develop, it's important to know the signs and symptoms of bruxism and to seek regular dental care."

She advised me to practice meditation, mindfulness and CBT as well.  She explained to me the great positive impact of the meditation, mindfulness on the brain activity (neuroplasticity). Since then, I've been practicing these techniques. The result was awesome. I no longer suffer from my social anxiety and my life has completely changed to the positive side. No more worry, stress, anxiety, etc.  But at the same time, I started to suffer from chronic insomnia until now. Of course, Im always in touch with my psychiatrist who has prescribed me the necessary and still following me up. Even tough, my insomnia doesn't improved.  Unfortunately, nobody can determine the real cause of my insomnia.  If I know the cause, I'll do my best to find the key to resolve this problem.

                "answer": "Secondary Insomnia                  Secondary insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem. This type of insomnia often is a symptom of an emotional, neurological, or other medical or sleep disorder.                  Emotional disorders that can cause insomnia include depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are examples of neurological disorders that can cause insomnia.                  Many other disorders or factors also can cause insomnia, such as:                  Conditions that cause chronic (ongoing) pain, such as arthritis and headache disorders                  Conditions that make it hard to breathe, such as asthma and heart failure                  An overactive thyroid                  Gastrointestinal disorders, such as heartburn                  Stroke                  Sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep-related breathing problems                  Menopause and hot flashes                  Secondary insomnia also can be a side effect of some medicines. For example, certain asthma medicines, such as theophylline, and some allergy and cold medicines can cause insomnia. Beta blockers also can cause the condition. These medicines are used to treat heart conditions.                  Commonly used substances also can cause insomnia. Examples include caffeine and other stimulants, tobacco and other nicotine products, and alcohol and other sedatives.                  Primary Insomnia                  Primary insomnia isn't a symptom or side effect of another medical condition. It is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isn\u2019t well understood. Primary insomnia usually lasts for at least 1 month.                  Many life changes can trigger primary insomnia. It may be due to major or long-lasting stress or emotional upset. Travel or other factors, such as work schedules that disrupt your sleep routine, also may trigger primary insomnia.                  Even if these issues are resolved, the insomnia may not go away. Trouble sleeping can persist because of habits formed to deal with the lack of sleep. These habits might include taking naps, worrying about sleep, and going to bed early.                  Researchers continue to try to find out whether some people are born with an increased risk for primary insomnia."

Infants with this condition often have a high-pitched cry that sounds like that of a cat. The disorder is characterized by intellectual disability and delayed development, small head size (microcephaly), low birth weight, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy. Affected individuals also have distinctive facial features, including widely set eyes (hypertelorism), low-set ears, a small jaw, and a rounded face. Some children with cri-du-chat syndrome are born with a heart defect. These resources provide more information about this condition or associated symptoms.

Treatments may include:  - Surgery to remove the tumor  - Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells  - Radiation therapy to destroy cancerous tissue  - Targeted therapy to keep cancer from growing and spreading\u00a0   Surgery  Stage 0 colon cancer may be treated by removing the tumor. This is done using colonoscopy. For stages I, II, and III cancer, more extensive surgery is needed to remove the part of the colon that is cancerous. This surgery is called colon resection\u00a0(colectomy).  Chemotherapy  Almost all people with stage III colon cancer receive chemotherapy after surgery for 6 to 8 months. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Even though the tumor was removed, chemotherapy is given to treat any cancer cells that may be left.  Chemotherapy is also used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in people with stage IV colon cancer.  You may receive just one type of medicine or a combination of medicines.   Radiation  Radiation therapy is sometimes used for colon cancer. It is usually used in combination with chemotherapy for people with stage III rectal cancer.  For people with stage IV disease that has spread to the liver, treatment directed at the liver can be used. This may include:  - Burning the cancer (ablation)  - Delivering chemotherapy or radiation directly into the liver  - Freezing the cancer (cryotherapy)  - Surgery   Targeted Therapy  - Targeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Targeted therapy may be given as pills or may be injected into a vein.  - You may have targeted therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment. \u00a0"

Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home."

Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.   Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.  If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).  If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa."

Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder.  Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.  Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected people may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. Medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible."

                "type": "dosage",
                "answer": "Initial Treatment  Celexa (citalopram HBr) should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended.  Celexa should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Special Populations  20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mg/day only for nonresponding patients.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Celexa should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester  Neonates exposed to Celexa and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS). When treating pregnant women with Celexa during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering Celexa in the third trimester. Maintenance Treatment  It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of Celexa in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of Celexa (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of Celexa 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered. Discontinuation of Treatment with Celexa  Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Celexa and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor  At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of Celexa therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Celexa before starting an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS)."

The diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed below. When the person with suspected ADHD is a child, parents and teachers are usually involved during the evaluation process.  Most children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health problem. This problem may be a mood, anxiety or substance use disorder; a learning disability; or a tic disorder. A doctor can help determine whether these other conditions are present. Symptoms  ADHD symptoms fall into three groups:    Not being able to focus (inattentiveness)  Being extremely active (hyperactivity)  Not being able to control behavior (impulsivity)  Some people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. Others have a combination of these behaviors.    INATTENTIVE SYMPTOMS    Doesn't pay attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork  Has problems focusing during tasks or play  Doesn't listen when spoken to directly  Doesn't follow through on instructions and doesn't finish schoolwork or chores  Has problems organizing tasks and activities  Avoids or doesn't like tasks that require mental effort (such as schoolwork)  Often loses things, such as homework or toys  Is easily distracted  Is often forgetful  HYPERACTIVITY SYMPTOMS    Fidgets or squirms in seat  Leaves their seat when they should stay in their seat  Runs about or climbs when they shouldn't be doing so  Has problems playing or working quietly  Is often \"on the go,\" acts as if \"driven by a motor\"  Talks all the time  IMPULSIVITY SYMPTOMS    Blurts out answers before questions have been completed  Has problems awaiting their turn  Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games)  Many of the above findings are present in children as they grow. For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development."

Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH\u2019s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR\u2019s news release  to learn more about the study\u2019s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions.

                "answer": "Some cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are linked to cancer treatment, but in most cases the cause is unknown.  Over the past few years, scientists have made progress in understanding how certain changes in the DNA of bone marrow cells may cause CMML to develop. DNA is the chemical that carries the instructions for nearly everything our cells do. We usually look like our parents because they are the source of our DNA. However, DNA affects more than the way we look.  Some genes (parts of DNA) control a cell\u2019s growth and division process. Genes that promote cell division are called oncogenes. Other genes called tumor suppressor genes can slow down cell division or even make cells die at an appropriate time. Cancers can be caused by DNA mutations (gene defects) that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes.  In some diseases, mutations may be passed down from a parent. Inherited mutations do not seem to cause CMML. Instead, the mutations are acquired during the person\u2019s lifetime. Exposure to radiation or cancer-causing chemicals can cause mutations that lead to CMML. Sometimes these gene changes occur for no apparent reason. Every time a cell prepares to divide into 2 new cells, it must copy its DNA. This process is not perfect, and copying errors can occur. Fortunately, cells have repair enzymes that read and fix DNA. However, some errors may slip past, especially if the cells are growing rapidly.  Human DNA is packaged in 23 pairs of chromosomes. In up to half of patients, CMML cells contain altered chromosomes. Sometimes part of one chromosome attaches to a different chromosome. This is called a translocation. Like mutations, translocations can turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes. Acquired translocations are seen in some cases of CMML. Another chromosome abnormality that can be seen in CMML is called a deletion. This involves the loss of all or part of a chromosome. Another type of chromosome abnormality is called a duplication. This is when there is an extra copy of all or part of a chromosome. "

                "answer": "People with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) may have questions about their prognosis and survival. Prognosis and survival depend on many factors. Only a doctor familiar with a person\u2019s medical history, type of cancer, stage, characteristics of the cancer, treatments chosen and response to treatment can put all of this information together with survival statistics to arrive at a prognosis.  A prognosis is the doctor\u2019s best estimate of how cancer will affect a person and how it will respond to treatment. A prognostic factor is an aspect of the cancer or a characteristic of the person that the doctor will consider when making a prognosis. A predictive factor influences how a cancer will respond to a certain treatment. Prognostic and predictive factors are often discussed together and they both play a part in deciding on a treatment plan and a prognosis."

Leukemia Starts in Bone Marrow Types of blood cells made by the bone marrow and a description of their functions. - Click to enlarge in new window. Click for more information  Leukemia usually begins in the bone marrow, the soft material in the center of most bones where blood cells are formed. The bone marrow makes three types of blood cells, and each type has a special function.      White blood cells fight infection and disease.     Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.     Platelets help control bleeding by forming blood clots.  In people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells, called leukemia cells. At first, leukemia cells function almost normally. But over time, as more leukemia cells are produced, they may crowd out the healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This makes it difficult for the blood to carry out its normal functions.  There are four common types of adult leukemia. Two are chronic, meaning they get worse over a longer period of time. The other two are acute, meaning they get worse quickly.      chronic lymphocytic leukemia     chronic myeloid leukemia     acute myeloid leukemia     acute lymphocytic leukemia "

The choice of treatment depends on your age and general health, the type of leukemia you have, whether or not it has spread outside the bone marrow, and other factors. If tests show that you have leukemia, you should talk with your doctor and make treatment decisions as soon as possible, although many patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia do not require treatment for many years. Working With a Team of Specialists A team of specialists often treats people with leukemia. The team will keep the primary doctor informed about the patient's progress. The team may include a hematologist who is a specialist in blood and blood-forming tissues, a medical oncologist who is a specialist in cancer treatment, and a radiation oncologist who is a specialist in radiation therapy. Before starting treatment, you may want another doctor to review the diagnosis and treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion. Others may pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Clinical Trials for Leukemia Some leukemia patients take part in studies of new treatments. These studies, called clinical trials, are designed to find out whether a new treatment is safe and effective and better than current treatments. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in taking part in a clinical trial.

                "answer": "During the early stages of leukemia, there may be no symptoms. Many of the symptoms of leukemia don't become apparent until a large number of normal blood cells are crowded out by leukemia cells. Symptoms of Chronic and Acute Leukemia In chronic leukemia, symptoms develop gradually and, in the beginning, are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia. Chronic leukemia is usually found during a routine doctor's exam before symptoms are present. When symptoms appear, they generally are mild at first and gradually get worse, but sometimes they don't worsen until many years after an initial diagnosis. Recently, researchers discovered that abnormal white blood cells can be present in the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients a number of years before a diagnosis. This finding may lead to a better understanding of the cellular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease and how the disease progresses. In acute leukemia, symptoms usually appear and get worse quickly. People with this disease usually go to their doctor because they feel sick. White Blood Cell Levels May Be High People with leukemia may have very high levels of white blood cells, but because the cells are abnormal, they are unable to fight infection. Therefore, patients may develop frequent fevers or infections. A shortage of red blood cells, called anemia, can cause a person to feel tired. Not having enough blood platelets may cause a person to bleed and bruise easily. Some symptoms depend on where leukemia cells collect in the body. Leukemia cells can collect in many different tissues and organs, such as the digestive tract, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, or other parts of the body, including the eyes, brain, and testicles. Other Common Symptoms Other common symptoms of leukemia include headache, weight loss, pain in the bones or joints, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from an enlarged spleen), and swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck or armpit. Symptoms of acute leukemia may include vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, and seizures. Some of the symptoms of leukemia are similar to those caused by the flu or other common diseases, so these symptoms are not sure signs of leukemia. It is important to check with your doctor if you have these symptoms. Only a doctor can diagnose and treat leukemia.

About half of the women with gonorrhea are also infected with chlamydia. Chlamydia is treated at the same time as a gonorrhea infection.  You will need a follow-up visit 7 days after if your symptoms include joint pain, skin rash, or more severe pelvic or belly pain. Tests will be done to make sure the infection is gone.  Sexual partners must be tested and treated to prevent passing the infection back and forth. You and your partner must finish all of the antibiotics. Use condoms until you both have finished taking your antibiotics.  All sexual contacts of the person with gonorrhea should be contacted and tested. This helps prevent further spread of the infection.  - In some places you may be able to take information and medicines to your sexual partner yourself.  - In other places, the health department will contact your partner."

Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch"

You doctor can also prescribe a pill that you only take by mouth once.  If your symptoms are worse or you get vaginal yeast infections often, you may need:  - Medicine for up to 14 days  - Clotrimazole vaginal suppository or fluconazole pill every week to prevent new infections    To help prevent and treat vaginal discharge:  - Keep your genital area clean and dry. Avoid soap and rinse with water only. Sitting in a warm, but not hot, bath may help your symptoms.  - Avoid douching. Although many women feel cleaner if they douche after their period or intercourse, it may worsen vaginal discharge. Douching removes healthy bacteria lining the vagina that protect against infection.  - Eat yogurt with live cultures or take Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets when you are on antibiotics. This will help to prevent a yeast infection.  - Use condoms to avoid catching or spreading infections.  - Avoid using feminine hygiene sprays, fragrances, or powders in the genital area.  - Avoid wearing tight-fitting pants or shorts, which may cause irritation.  - Wear cotton underwear or cotton-crotch pantyhose. Avoid underwear made of silk or nylon, because they can increase sweating in the genital area, which can cause irritation.  - Use pads and not tampons.  - Keep your blood sugar levels under good control if you have diabetes.  -  Avoid wearing wet bathing suits or exercise clothing for long periods of time.

                "answer": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Males have only one copy of the X chromosome from their mother and one copy of the Y chromosome from their father. If their X chromosome has a DMD gene mutation, they will have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Females, on the other hand, have two copies of the X chromosomes.. Since females have two copies of this gene, if one copy does not work, they have a second back up copy to produce the dystrophin protein. A woman who has a genetic change in one of her two copies is said to be \"a carrier\" of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Carriers do not have Duchenne muscular dystrophy and most are unaware that they even carry this change in their genetic material unless they have a family history. However, recent studies have shown that some carrier females (approximately 20 percent) will show symptoms of DMD, including muscle weakness and cardiac abnormalities.  With an X-linked recessive condition, the chance of passing on the changed (non-working) copy of the gene to a child is different for males and females.  Females who carry the changed copy of the gene have a 50 percent chance of passing it on with each pregnancy. Thus, there is a 25 percent chance of having a affected child with DMD (eg., 50 percent of boys have the chance of having DMD and 50 percent of girls will be carriers). The chance of a woman who has one affected son (and no family history) of being a carrier of the changed DMD gene is approximately 2/3. However, in the remaining third of individuals with DMD, the change in the dystrophin gene is a new genetic change, or de novo change and about 10 percent of new mutations are due to gonadal mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism refers to a condition where an individual has two or more cell populations that differ in genetic makeup in their eggs or sperm.  Males who inherit or are born with a changed copy of the DMD gene will have DMD since they have a Y chromosome, and do not have back-up X chromosome. If a male with DMD were to have children, all of his daughters would be carriers and none of his sons would be affected.  Currently various reproductive options are available to families. The preconception options include MicroSort which is a technology that can separate sperm containing X chromosomes allowing for an increase in chances of having a female. The second reproductive option is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which is a technique that can allow the cells of a fertilized egg to be tested to determine if it contains a change in the DMD gene and then implant those eggs which do not. The post conception options include Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis which analyze sampled cells derived from the developing fetus.  Several of the prenatal testing options for pregnancies at increased risk are available when the DMD disease-causing mutation has been identified in a family member, or if informative, genetically-linked markers have been identified."

Steroid drugs can slow the loss of muscle strength. They may be started when the child is diagnosed or when muscle strength begins to decline.  Other treatments may include:  - Albuterol--a drug used for people with asthma  - Amino acids  - Carnitine  - Coenzyme Q10  - Creatine  - Fish oil  - Green tea extracts  - Vitamin E   However, the effects of these treatments have not been proven. Stem cells and gene therapy may be used in the future.  Activity is encouraged. Inactivity (such as bedrest) can\u00a0make the muscle disease worse. Physical therapy may help to maintain muscle strength and function. Speech therapy is often needed.  Other treatments may include:  - Assisted ventilation (used during the day or night)  - Drugs to help heart function, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics  - Orthopedic appliances (such as braces and wheelchairs) to improve mobility  - Proton pump inhibitors (for people with gastroesophageal reflux)   Several new treatments are being studied in trials."

Most people who follow these treatments recover and return to normal activities. Some people will need to have more treatment. This may include steroid injections or surgery.  MEDICINES  Medicines can help with your pain. Your doctor may prescribe any of the following:  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term pain control  - Narcotics if the pain is severe and does not respond to NSAIDs  - Medicines to calm the nerves  - Muscle relaxants to relieve back spasms    LIFESTYLE CHANGES  If you are overweight, diet and exercise are very important for improving back pain.  Physical therapy is important for nearly everyone with disk disease. Therapists will teach you how to properly lift, dress, walk, and perform other activities. They teach you how to strengthen muscles that help support the spine. You will also learn how to increase flexibility in your spine and legs.  Take care of your back at home:   - Reduce activity for the first few days. Slowly restart your usual activities.  - Avoid heavy lifting or twisting your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain starts.  - After 2 to 3 weeks, gradually start exercising again.    INJECTIONS  Steroid medicine injections into the back in the area of the herniated disk may help control pain for several months. These injections reduce swelling around the disk and relieve many symptoms. Spinal injections are usually done in your doctor's office.   SURGERY  Surgery may be an option if your symptoms do not go away with other treatments and time.  Diskectomy is surgery to remove all or part of a disk.  Discuss with your doctor which treatment options are best for you."

In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in\u00a0substances called allergens or triggers.   Common asthma triggers include:  - Animals (pet hair or dander)  - Dust mites  - Certain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDS)  - Changes in weather (most often cold weather)  - Chemicals in the air or in food  - Exercise  - Mold  - Pollen  - Respiratory infections, such as the common cold  - Strong emotions (stress)  - Tobacco smoke   Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.  Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies."

                "answer": "Most cases of Turner syndrome are not inherited. Most commonly, Turner syndrome occurs due to a random event during the formation of an egg or sperm cell in a parent (prior to conception). For example, if an egg or sperm cell mistakenly loses a sex chromosome, and joins at conception with an egg or sperm containing an X chromosome, the resulting child will have a single X chromosome in each cell. Mosaic Turner syndrome, occurring when a person has some cells with one X chromosome and some cells with two sex chromosomes, is also not inherited. This also occurs due to a random event, during early fetal development rather than before conception. In rare cases, Turner syndrome may be caused by a missing piece (partial deletion) of the X chromosome. A deletion can be inherited from a parent. Genetic testing of an affected fetus or child can identify the type of Turner syndrome present and may help to estimate the risk of recurrence. People with questions about genetic testing or recurrence risks for Turner syndrome are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional."

He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do's and Don'ts Do's - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often. That will make chewing and swallowing easier when eating.  - Do chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow.  - Do use a humidifier at night to promote moisture in the air while you sleep.

Don't use tobacco or alcohol. They dry out the mouth. Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH\u2019s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR\u2019s news release  to learn more about the study\u2019s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently."

Today, HIV treatment is recommended for all people with HIV infection, even if their CD4 count is still normal.  Regular blood tests are needed to make sure the virus level in the blood (viral load) is kept low, or suppressed. The goal of treatment is to lower the HIV virus in the blood to a level that is so low that the test can't detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load.

                "answer": "Summary       If you have lupus, your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.     Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American women. The cause of lupus is not known.     Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are        - Joint pain or swelling     - Muscle pain     - Fever with no known cause     - Fatigue    - Red rashes, often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")       There is no one test to diagnose lupus, and it may take months or years to make the diagnosis. There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "answer": "Treatment depends on the type of stone and the severity of your symptoms.  Kidney stones that are small most often pass through your system on their own.   - Your urine should be strained so the stone can be saved and tested.  - Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine. This will help the stone pass.  - Pain can be very bad. Over-the-counter pain medicines (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen), either alone or along with narcotics, can be very effective.    Some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital. You may need to get fluids through a vein.  For some types of stones, your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help break down and remove the material that is causing the stone. These medicines can include:  - Allopurinol (for uric acid stones)  - Antibiotics (for struvite stones)  - Diuretics  - Phosphate solutions  - Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate  - Water pills (thiazide diuretics)  - Tamsulosin to relax the ureter and help the stone pass    Surgery is often needed if:  - The stone is too large to pass on its own  - The stone is growing  - The stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage  - The pain cannot be controlled     Today, most treatments are much less invasive than in the past.  - Lithotripsy is used to remove stones slightly smaller than a half an inch that are located in the kidney or ureter. It uses sound or shock waves to break up stones. Then, the stone fragments leave the body in the urine. It is also called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or ESWL.  - Procedures performed by passing a special instrument through a small surgical cut in your skin and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones, or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed. The stone is removed with a tube (endoscope).  - Ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract.  - Rarely, open surgery (nephrolithotomy) may be needed if other methods do not work or are not possible.    Talk to your provider about what treatment options may work for you."

The urinary problems associated with Ochoa syndrome typically become apparent in early childhood or adolescence. People with this disorder may have difficulty controlling the flow of urine (incontinence), which can lead to bedwetting. Individuals with Ochoa syndrome may be unable to completely empty the bladder, often resulting in vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine backs up into the ducts that normally carry it from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters). Urine may also accumulate in the kidneys (hydronephrosis). Vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis can lead to frequent infections of the urinary tract and kidney inflammation (pyelonephritis), causing damage that may eventually result in kidney failure.  Individuals with Ochoa syndrome also exhibit a characteristic frown-like facial grimace when they try to smile or laugh, often described as inversion of facial expression. While this feature may appear earlier than the urinary tract symptoms, perhaps as early as an infant begins to smile, it is often not brought to medical attention.  Approximately two-thirds of individuals with Ochoa syndrome also experience problems with bowel function, such as constipation, loss of bowel control, or muscle spasms of the anus."

                "answer": "RA most often requires lifelong treatment, including medicines, physical therapy, exercise, education, and possibly surgery. Early, aggressive treatment for RA can with newer drug categories can be very helpful slowing joint destruction and preventing deformities.  MEDICINES  Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are often the drugs that are tried first in people with RA. They are prescribed along with rest, strengthening exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs.  - Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) is the most commonly used DMARD for rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide (Arava) and hydroxychloroquine may also be used.  - Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug that is often combined with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy).  - These drugs may have serious side effects, so you will need frequent blood tests when taking them.    Anti-inflammatory medications: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen.  - Although NSAIDs work well, long-term use can cause stomach problems, including ulcers and bleeding, and possible heart problems.  - Celecoxib (Celebrex) is another anti-inflammatory drug. Drugs in this class (COX-2 inhibitors) may increase heart attack and stroke risk for some people. Talk to your doctor about whether these medicines are right for you.    Antimalarial medications: This group of medicines includes hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). They are most often used along with methotrexate. It may be weeks or months before you see any benefit from these drugs.  Corticosteroids: These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible.  Biologic agents: These drugs are designed to affect parts of the immune system that play a role in the disease process of rheumatoid arthritis.  They may be given when other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis have not worked. Sometimes biologic drugs are started sooner, along with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs.  Most of them are given either under the skin (subcutaneously) or into a vein (intravenously). There are different types of biologic agents:  - White blood cell modulators include: abatacept (Orencia) and rituximab (Rituxan)  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors include: adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), golimumab (Simponi), and certolizumab (Cimzia)  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors: tocilizumab (Actemra)    Biologic agents can be very helpful in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, people taking these drugs must be watched very closely because of serious risk factors:  - Infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi  - Leukemia or lymphoma  - Psoriasis  - Allergic reactions    Other drugs:  - Janus kinase inhibitor: Tofacitinib (Xeljanz). This is a medicine taken by mouth that is now approved for treating RA.    SURGERY  Surgery may be needed to correct severely damaged joints. Surgery may include:  - Removal of the joint lining (synovectomy)  - Total joint replacement in extreme cases; may include total knee, hip replacement, ankle replacement, shoulder replacement, and others    PHYSICAL THERAPY  Range-of-motion exercises and exercise programs prescribed by a physical therapist can delay the loss of joint function and help keep muscles strong.  Sometimes, therapists will use special machines to apply deep heat or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and improve joint movement.  Other therapies that may help ease joint pain include:  - Joint protection techniques  - Heat and cold treatments  - Splints or orthotic devices to support and align joints  - Frequent rest periods between activities, as well as 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night    NUTRITION  Some people with RA may have intolerance or allergies to certain foods. A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided."

                "answer": "Treatment for adenocarcinoma\u00a0depends on the stage of the tumor.  Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach.  When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended.   When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used.  With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to\u00a0manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve loss of appetite, jaundice, and itching of the skin."

As many as half of all women and a quarter of men older than 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis.    Risk factors include        -  Getting older     -  Being small and thin     -  Having a family history of osteoporosis    -  Taking certain medicines    -  Being a white or Asian woman    -  Having osteopenia, which is low bone density       Osteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health. To keep bones strong, eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, exercise and do not smoke. If needed, medicines can also help.

Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years.  Your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you're recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm \u2014 such as a stroke or a mastectomy.  Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule. In a small percentage of cases, arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely.  It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder, but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder."

Hypertension is the term used to describe high blood pressure.  Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers. The top number is called the systolic blood pressure. The bottom number is called the diastolic blood pressure. For example, 120 over 80 (written as 120/80 mmHg).   One or both of these numbers can be too high. (Note: These numbers apply to people who are not taking medicines for blood pressure and are not ill.)  - Normal blood pressure is when your blood pressure is lower than 120/80 mmHg most of the time.  - High blood pressure (hypertension) is when your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or above most of the time.  - If your blood pressure numbers are 120/80 or higher, but below 140/90, it is called pre-hypertension.    If you have heart or kidney problems, or you had a stroke, your doctor may want your blood pressure to be even lower than that of people who do not have these conditions."

Follow your doctor's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.  MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA\u00a0  There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:  - Control medicines to help prevent attacks  - Quick-relief (rescue)\u00a0medicines for use during attacks   LONG-TERM MEDICINES  These are also called maintenance or control medicines.\u00a0They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.  Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you.  QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES  These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:  - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack  - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise   Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs.  Quick-relief\u00a0medicines include:  - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators  - Oral corticosteroids for\u00a0when you have an asthma attack that is not going away   A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given\u00a0oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).  ASTHMA CARE AT HOME  - Know the asthma symptoms to watch for.  - Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.  - Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when this happens.  - Know how to care for your asthma when you exercise.   Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include:  - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable  - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them  - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your doctor or nurse   A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs.  - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help\u00a0let you know\u00a0when you need to take\u00a0medicine or other action.  - Peak flow values of 50 to 80% of\u00a0your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack.\u00a0Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack."

If you have pre-hypertension, your provider will recommend lifestyle changes to bring your blood pressure down to a normal range. Medicines are rarely used for pre-hypertension.  LIFESTYLE CHANGES  You can do many things to help control your blood pressure at home, including:  - Eat a heart-healthy diet, including potassium and fiber.  - Drink plenty of water.  - Exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a day.  - If you smoke, quit.  - Limit how much alcohol you drink to 1 drink a day for women, and 2 a day for men.  - Limit the amount of sodium (salt) you eat. Aim for less than 1,500 mg per day.  - Reduce stress. Try to avoid things that cause you stress, and try meditation or yoga to de-stress.  - Stay at a healthy body weight.     Your provider can help you find programs for losing weight, stopping smoking, and exercising.  You can also get a referral to a dietitian, who can help you plan a diet that is healthy for you.  How low your blood pressure should be and at what level you need to start treatment is individualized, based on your age and any medical problems you have.  MEDICINES FOR HYPERTENSION  Most of the time, your provider will try lifestyle changes first and check your BP 2 or more times. Medicines will likely be started if your BP readings remain at or above these levels:  - Top number (systolic pressure) of 140 or more in people younger than 60 years  - Top number of 150 or more in people 60 years and older  - Bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 90 or more    If you have diabetes, heart problems, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure reading. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 130 to 140/80 mmHg.  There are many different medicines to treat high blood pressure.  - Often, a single blood pressure drug may not be enough to control your blood pressure, and you may need to take two or more drugs.  - It is very important that you take the medicines prescribed to you.  - If you have side effects, your doctor can substitute a different medicine."

He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do's and Don'ts Do's - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often. That will make chewing and swallowing easier when eating.  - Do chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow.  - Do use a humidifier at night to promote moisture in the air while you sleep.

Don't use tobacco or alcohol. They dry out the mouth. Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH\u2019s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR\u2019s news release  to learn more about the study\u2019s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently."

Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch"

Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that MD has the potential to reduce the number of duct excision procedures and minimise the extent of surgical resection. Imaging-guided vacuum-assisted core biopsy can be diagnostic and therapeutic for papillomas seen on mammography and/or ultrasound. Patients with multiple papillomas do have an increased risk of developing cancer and should be kept under annual review with regular mammography (preferably digital mammography) if treated conservatively. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be also used in surveillance in view of its high sensitivity. Because the risk is small, long term and affects both breasts, long-term follow-up is more appropriate than prophylactic mastectomy. Patients who prove to have solitary duct papilloma have insufficient increase in the risk of subsequent malignancy to justify routine follow-up. "

Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch"

To use this medicine:  - Thoroughly work the medicine into your pubic hair and surrounding area. Leave it on for at least 5 to 10 minutes, or as directed by your health care provider.  - Rinse well.  - Comb your pubic hair with a fine-toothed comb to remove eggs (nits). Applying vinegar to pubic hair before combing may help loosen the nits.    Most people need only 1 treatment. If a second treatment is needed, it should be done 4 days to 1 week later.  Over-the-counter medicines to treat lice include Rid and Nix. Malathione lotion is another option.  OTHER CARE  While you are treating pubic lice:  - Wash all clothing and bedding in hot water.  - Spray items that cannot be washed with a medicated spray that you can buy at the store. You can also seal items in plastic bags for 10 to 14 days to smother the lice.  - Makes sure anyone with whom you have had sexual contact or shared a bed is treated at the same time.    People with pubic lice should be checked for other sexually-transmitted infections when lice are discovered."

                "answer": "Taking in more calories than your body burns can lead to obesity. This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:  - Eating more food than your body can use  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Not getting enough exercise    Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.  Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally.   The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.   The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.   We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.   - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.  - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.  - People with little free time may have less time to exercise.    The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.  Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:  - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)  - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics    Other things that can cause weight gain are:  - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting.  - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well  - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause.  - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy."

Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth.     Cancer treatment can be local or systemic:  - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.  - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.    Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (curing). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.  - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment.  - Stage I and II -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery.  - Stage III -- Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy.  - Stage IV -- Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.    After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment.  Women who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later."

                "answer": "Polymicrogyria is a condition characterized by abnormal development of the brain before birth. The surface of the brain normally has many ridges or folds, called gyri. In people with polymicrogyria, the brain develops too many folds, and the folds are unusually small. The name of this condition literally means too many (poly-) small (micro-) folds (-gyria) in the surface of the brain.  Polymicrogyria can affect part of the brain or the whole brain. When the condition affects one side of the brain, researchers describe it as unilateral. When it affects both sides of the brain, it is described as bilateral. The signs and symptoms associated with polymicrogyria depend on how much of the brain, and which particular brain regions, are affected.  Researchers have identified multiple forms of polymicrogyria. The mildest form is known as unilateral focal polymicrogyria. This form of the condition affects a relatively small area on one side of the brain. It may cause minor neurological problems, such as mild seizures that can be easily controlled with medication. Some people with unilateral focal polymicrogyria do not have any problems associated with the condition.  Bilateral forms of polymicrogyria tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Signs and symptoms of these conditions can include recurrent seizures (epilepsy), delayed development, crossed eyes, problems with speech and swallowing, and muscle weakness or paralysis. The most severe form of the disorder, bilateral generalized polymicrogyria, affects the entire brain. This condition causes severe intellectual disability, problems with movement, and seizures that are difficult or impossible to control with medication.  Polymicrogyria most often occurs as an isolated feature, although it can occur with other brain abnormalities. It is also a feature of several genetic syndromes characterized by intellectual disability and multiple birth defects. These include 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Adams-Oliver syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Galloway-Mowat syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Zellweger spectrum disorder."

                "answer": "There are two major types of stroke:   - Ischemic stroke  - Hemorrhagic stroke    Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways:   - A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke.  - A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.    Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.       Watch this video about:   Stroke         Watch this video about:   Stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism     A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:   - Aneurysm  - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)    Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin). Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke.   An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke.  High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are:  - Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation  - Diabetes  - Family history of stroke  - High cholesterol  - Increasing age, especially after age 55  - Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke)        Watch this video about:   Hypertension - overview     Stroke risk is also higher in:   - People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries  - People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and lack of exercise  - Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35)  - Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant  - Women who take hormone replacement therapy"

This condition is characterized by the formation of tiny round cysts in the outermost layer of the cornea, called the corneal epithelium. This part of the cornea acts as a barrier to help prevent foreign materials, such as dust and bacteria, from entering the eye.  In people with Meesmann corneal dystrophy, cysts can appear as early as the first year of life. They usually affect both eyes and increase in number over time. The cysts usually do not cause any symptoms until late adolescence or adulthood, when they start to break open (rupture) on the surface of the cornea and cause irritation. The resulting symptoms typically include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), twitching of the eyelids (blepharospasm), increased tear production, the sensation of having a foreign object in the eye, and an inability to tolerate wearing contact lenses. Some affected individuals also have temporary episodes of blurred vision."

                "answer": "Summary       Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germs, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia. You can also get pneumonia by inhaling a liquid or chemical. People most at risk are older than 65 or younger than 2 years of age, or already have health problems.    Symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe. See your doctor promptly if you       - Have a high fever    - Have shaking chills    - Have a cough with phlegm that doesn't improve or gets worse    - Develop shortness of breath with normal daily activities    - Have chest pain when you breathe or cough    - Feel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu       Your doctor will use your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests to diagnose pneumonia. Treatment depends on what kind you have. If bacteria are the cause, antibiotics should help. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.    Preventing pneumonia is always better than treating it. Vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu. Other preventive measures include washing your hands frequently and not smoking.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"

                "answer": "Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia you have and how severe it is. Most people who have community-acquired pneumonia\u2014the most common type of pneumonia\u2014are treated at home.                  The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and prevent complications.                  General Treatment                  If you have pneumonia, follow your treatment plan, take all medicines as prescribed, and get ongoing medical care. Ask your doctor when you should schedule followup care. Your doctor may want you to have a chest x ray to make sure the pneumonia is gone.                  Although you may start feeling better after a few days or weeks, fatigue (tiredness) can persist for up to a month or more. People who are treated in the hospital may need at least 3 weeks before they can go back to their normal routines.                  Bacterial Pneumonia                  Bacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.                  Most people begin to improve after 1 to 3 days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms, such as cough and fever.                  Viral Pneumonia                  Antibiotics don't work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.                  Viral pneumonia usually improves in 1 to 3 weeks.                  Treating Severe Symptoms                  You may need to be treated in a hospital if:                  Your symptoms are severe                  You're at risk for complications because of other health problems                  If the level of oxygen in your bloodstream is low, you may receive oxygen therapy. If you have bacterial pneumonia, your doctor may give you antibiotics through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein."

The goal of treatment is to restore proper function and strength to the back, and prevent recurrence of the injury. Medications are often used to treat acute and chronic low back pain. Effective pain relief may involve a combination of prescription drugs and over-the-counter remedies. Although the use of cold and hot compresses has never been scientifically proven to quickly resolve low back injury, compresses may help reduce pain and inflammation and allow greater mobility for some individuals. Bed rest is recommended for only 1\u20132 days at most. Individuals should resume activities as soon as possible. Exercise may be the most effective way to speed recovery from low back pain and help strengthen back and abdominal muscles. In the most serious cases, when the condition does not respond to other therapies, surgery may relieve pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries."

Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke.   Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves.  If treatment with clot-busting drugs is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, patients often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these drugs, or they can't take these drugs because of a health condition.  People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).

DESCRIPTION    Azithromycin for oral suspension, USP contain the active ingredient azithromycin, an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics, for oral administration. Azithromycin has the chemical name (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)-13-[(2,6-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-3-O-methyl-\u03b1-L-ribohexopyranosyl) oxy]-2-ethyl-3,4,10-trihydroxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-heptamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3- (dimethylamino)-\u03b2-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopentadecan-15-one. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring. Its molecular formula is C38H72N2O12, and its molecular weight is 749.00.    Azithromycin has the following structural formula:    Azithromycin, as the monohydrate, is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C38H72N2O12\u2022H2O and a molecular weight of 767.0.    Each tablet for oral administration contains azithromycin monohydrate equivalent to either 250 mg or 500 mg azithromycin. In addition each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, polyethylene glycol, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, partially pregelantinized starch, sodium citrate, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide and FD&C Blue No. 2 (500 mg only)."

This may occur if:  - You have a sudden drop in blood pressure.  - Your body does not have enough water (is dehydrated) because of vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and other conditions.  - You get up too quickly after sitting or lying down (this is more common in older people).    Lightheadedness may also occur if you have the flu, low blood sugar, a cold, or allergies.  More serious conditions that can lead to light-headedness include:  - Heart problems, such as a heart attack or abnormal heart beat  - Stroke  - Bleeding inside the body  - Shock (extreme drop in blood pressure)    If any of these serious disorders are present, you will usually also have symptoms like chest pain, a feeling of a racing heart, loss of speech, change in vision, or other symptoms.  Vertigo may be due to:  - Benign positional vertigo, a spinning feeling that occurs when you move your head  - Labyrinthitis, a viral infection of the inner ear that usually follows a cold or flu  - Meniere's disease, a common inner ear problem    Other causes of lightheadedness or vertigo may include:  - Use of certain medicines  - Stroke  - Multiple sclerosis  - Seizures  - Brain tumor  - Bleeding in the brain"

To apply the patches, follow these steps:      Look at the skin that you plan to cover with a lidocaine patch. If the skin is broken or blistered, do not apply a patch to that area.     Use scissors to remove the outer seal from the package. Then pull apart the zipper seal.     Remove up to three patches from the package and press the zipper seal tightly together. The remaining patches may dry out if the zipper seal is not tightly closed.     Cut patch(es) to the size and shape that will cover your most painful area.     Peel the transparent liner off the back of the patch(es).     Press the patch(es) firmly onto your skin. If you are applying a patch to your face, be careful not to let it touch your eyes.

Information on additional adverse events associated with the extended-release formulation of bupropion in smoking cessation trials, as well as the immediate-release formulation of bupropion, is included in a separate section (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Other Events Observed During the Clinical Development and Postmarketing Experience of Bupropion).  Incidence in Controlled Trials with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR)  Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Among Patients Treated with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR)  In placebo-controlled clinical trials, 9% and 11% of patients treated with 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The specific adverse events in these trials that led to discontinuation in at least 1% of patients treated with either 300 mg/day or 400 mg/day of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and at a rate at least twice the placebo rate are listed in Table 4.  Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Patients Treated with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR)  Table 5 enumerates treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred among patients treated with 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and with placebo in placebo-controlled trials. Events that occurred in either the 300-mg/day or 400-mg/day group at an incidence of 1% or more and were more frequent than in the placebo group are included. Reported adverse events were classified using a COSTART-based Dictionary.  Accurate estimates of the incidence of adverse events associated with the use of any drug are difficult to obtain. Estimates are influenced by drug dose, detection technique, setting, physician judgments, etc. The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. These incidence figures also cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.  Finally, it is important to emphasize that the tabulation does not reflect the relative severity and/or clinical importance of the events. A better perspective on the serious adverse events associated with the use of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) is provided in the WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONSsections.  Incidence of Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Controlled Clinical Trials  Adverse events from Table 5 occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and at a rate at least twice the placebo rate are listed below for the 300-mg/day and 400-mg/day dose groups.  Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR) 300 mg/day: Anorexia, dry mouth, rash, sweating, tinnitus and tremor.  Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR) 400 mg/day: Abdominal pain, agitation, anxiety, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, myalgia, nausea, palpitation, pharyngitis, sweating, tinnitus and urinary frequency.  Other Events Observed During the Clinical Development and Postmarketing Experience of Bupropion  In addition to the adverse events noted above, the following events have been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing experience with the extended-release (SR) formulation of bupropion in depressed patients and in nondepressed smokers, as well as in clinical trials and postmarketing clinical experience with the immediate-release formulation of bupropion.  Adverse events for which frequencies are provided below occurred in clinical trials with the extended-release formulation of bupropion (SR). The frequencies represent the proportion of patients who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event on at least one occasion in placebo-controlled studies for depression (n = 987) or smoking cessation (n = 1,013) or patients who experienced an adverse event requiring discontinuation of treatment in an open-label surveillance study with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) (n = 3,100). All treatment-emergent adverse events are included except those listed in Tables 2 through 5, those events listed in other safety-related sections, those adverse events subsumed under COSTART terms that are either overly general or excessively specific so as to be uninformative, those events not reasonably associated with the use of the drug and those events that were not serious and occurred in fewer than 2 patients. Events of major clinical importance are described in the WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONSsections of the labeling.  Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions of frequency: Frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients. Infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, while rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.  Adverse events for which frequencies are not provided occurred in clinical trials or postmarketing experience with bupropion. Only those adverse events not previously listed for extended-release bupropion (SR) are included. The extent to which these events may be associated with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) are unknown.  Body (General):Infrequent were chills, facial edema, musculoskeletal chest pain and photosensitivity. Rare was malaise. Also observed were arthralgia, myalgia and fever with rash and other symptoms suggestive of delayed hypersensitivity. These symptoms may resemble serum sickness (see PRECAUTIONS).

Guanfacine extended-release (long-acting) tablets (Intuniv) are used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in children. Guanfacine is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonists. Guanfacine treats high blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. Guanfacine extended-release tablets may treat ADHD by affecting the part of the brain that controls attention and impulsivity.  High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation."

                "answer": "Duloxetine comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule to take by mouth. When duloxetine is used to treat depression, it is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. When duloxetine is used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, the pain of diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, or ongoing bone or muscle pain, it is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take duloxetine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take duloxetine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.    Swallow the delayed-release capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not open the delayed-release capsules and mix the contents with liquids or sprinkle the contents on food.    Your doctor may start you on a low dose of medication and increase your dose after one week.    Duloxetine may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. It may take 1 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of duloxetine. Continue to take duloxetine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking duloxetine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking duloxetine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; anxiety; dizziness; tiredness; headache; pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet; irritability; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; sweating; and nightmares. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of duloxetine is decreased."

                "answer": "Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that indicate kidney damage. Nephrotic syndrome includes the following:        proteinuria\u2014large amounts of protein in the urine      hyperlipidemia\u2014higher than normal fat and cholesterol levels in the blood      edema, or swelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face      hypoalbuminia\u2014low levels of albumin in the blood    Albumin is a protein that acts like a sponge, drawing extra fluid from the body into the bloodstream where it remains until removed by the kidneys. When albumin leaks into the urine, the blood loses its capacity to absorb extra fluid from the body, causing edema.    Nephrotic syndrome results from a problem with the kidneys\u2019 filters, called glomeruli. Glomeruli are tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that remove wastes and excess fluids from the blood and send them to the bladder as urine.    As blood passes through healthy kidneys, the glomeruli filter out the waste products and allow the blood to retain cells and proteins the body needs. However, proteins from the blood, such as albumin, can leak into the urine when the glomeruli are damaged. In nephrotic syndrome, damaged glomeruli allow 3 grams or more of protein to leak into the urine when measured over a 24-hour period, which is more than 20 times the amount that healthy glomeruli allow."

                "answer": "Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by diseases that affect only the kidneys, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or membranous nephropathy. Diseases that affect only the kidneys are called primary causes of nephrotic syndrome. The glomeruli are usually the targets of these diseases for reasons that are not fully understood. In FSGS\u2014the most common primary cause of nephrotic syndrome\u2014scar tissue forms in parts of the glomeruli. In membranous nephropathy, immune molecules form harmful deposits on the glomeruli. Nephrotic syndrome can also be caused by systemic diseases, which are diseases that affect many parts of the body, such as diabetes or lupus. Systemic diseases that affect the kidneys are called secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome. More than 50 percent of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults have secondary causes, with diabetes being the most common. "

                "type": "treatment",
                "answer": "Treating nephrotic syndrome includes addressing the underlying cause as well as taking steps to reduce high blood pressure, edema, high cholesterol, and the risks of infection. Treatment usually includes medications and changes in diet.    Medications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease causing nephrotic syndrome. Two types of blood pressure lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease by reducing the pressure inside the glomeruli and thereby reducing proteinuria. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretic\u2014a medication that aids the kidneys in removing fluid from the blood\u2014can also be useful in helping to reduce blood pressure as well as edema. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed.    Statin medications may be given to lower cholesterol.    People with nephrotic syndrome should receive the pneumococcal vaccine, which helps protect against a bacterium that commonly causes infection, and yearly flu shots.    Blood thinning medications are usually only given to people with nephrotic syndrome who develop a blood clot; these medications are not used as a preventive measure.    Nephrotic syndrome may go away once the underlying cause has been treated. More information about treating the underlying causes of nephrotic syndrome is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases."
