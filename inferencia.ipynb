      "   cat__answer_Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.  People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder.  Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.  Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected people may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. Medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.

      "   cat__answer_X-linked congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness). They also have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder. The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Researchers have identified two major types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: the complete form and the incomplete form. The types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause and by the results of a test called an electroretinogram, which measures the function of the retina.\\n  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_You can make many lifestyle changes to help treat your symptoms.  Other tips include:  - If you are overweight or obese, in many cases, losing weight can help.  - Avoid drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain.  - Take all of your medicines with plenty of water. When your doctor gives you a new medicine, ask whether it will make your heartburn worse.    You may use over-the-counter antacids after meals and at bedtime, although the relief may not last very long. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation.  Other over-the-counter and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids, but give you longer relief. Your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse can tell you how to take these drugs.  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach  - H2 blockers also lower the amount of acid released in the stomach    Anti-reflux surgery may be an option for people whose symptoms do not go away with lifestyle changes and medicines. Heartburn and other symptoms should improve after surgery. But you may still need to take drugs for your heartburn.  There are also new therapies for reflux that can be performed through an endoscope (a flexible tube passed through the mouth into the stomach).  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_You will have a pelvic exam. It may show:   - Swelling and redness of the skin of the vulva, in the vagina, and on the cervix   - Dry, white spots on the vaginal wall  - Cracks in the skin of the vulva.   A small amount of the vaginal discharge is examined using a microscope. This is called a wet mount and KOH test.  Sometimes, a culture is taken when the infection does not get better with treatment or comes back many times.  Your health care provider may order other tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your doctor may diagnose your child with achondroplasia while you’re pregnant or after your infant is born.    Diagnosis During Pregnancy  Some characteristics of achondroplasia are detectable during an ultrasound. These include hydrocephalus, or an abnormally large head. If your doctor suspects achondroplasia, genetic tests may be ordered. These tests look for the defective FGFR3 gene in a sample of amniotic fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the womb.    Diagnosis After Your Child Is Born  Your doctor can diagnose your child by looking at his or her features. The doctor may also order X-rays to measure the length of your infant’s bones. This can help confirm a diagnosis. Blood tests may also be ordered to look for the defective FGFR3 gene.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your health care provider can treat a wart if you do not like how it looks or if it is painful.  Do NOT attempt to remove a wart yourself by burning, cutting, tearing, picking, or by any other method.  MEDICINES  Over-the-counter medicines are available to remove warts.   Do NOT use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. Warts in these areas need to be treated by a health care provider.  To use wart-removal medicine:  - File the wart with a nail file or emery board when your skin is damp (for example, after a shower or bath). This helps remove dead tissue. Do not use the same emery board on your nails.  - Put the medicine on the wart every day for several weeks or months. Follow the instructions on the label.  - Cover the wart with a bandage to prevent it from spreading.     OTHER TREATMENTS  Special foot cushions can help ease the pain from plantar warts. You can buy these at drugstores without a prescription. Use socks. Wear shoes with plenty of room. Avoid high heels.  Your health care provider may need to trim away thick skin or calluses that form over warts on your foot or around nails.   Your provider may recommend the following treatments if your warts do not go away:  - Stronger (prescription) medicines  - A blistering solution   - Freezing the wart (cryotherapy) to remove it  - Burning the wart (electrocautery) to remove it  - Laser treatment for difficult to remove warts  - Immunotherapy, which gives you a shot of a substance that causes an allergic reaction and helps the wart go away  - Skin medicine called imiquimod    Genital warts are treated in a different way than most other warts.  A medicine called veregen may be used on genital warts, as well as on other warts.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your provider may recommend that you do the following:      Avoid activities that cause pain.     Put ice on the heel several times a day.     Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.     Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.     Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.   Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.  If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).  If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.  People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder.  Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.  Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected people may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. Medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.

      "   cat__answer_X-linked congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness). They also have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder. The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Researchers have identified two major types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: the complete form and the incomplete form. The types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause and by the results of a test called an electroretinogram, which measures the function of the retina.\\n  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_You can make many lifestyle changes to help treat your symptoms.  Other tips include:  - If you are overweight or obese, in many cases, losing weight can help.  - Avoid drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain.  - Take all of your medicines with plenty of water. When your doctor gives you a new medicine, ask whether it will make your heartburn worse.    You may use over-the-counter antacids after meals and at bedtime, although the relief may not last very long. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation.  Other over-the-counter and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids, but give you longer relief. Your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse can tell you how to take these drugs.  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach  - H2 blockers also lower the amount of acid released in the stomach    Anti-reflux surgery may be an option for people whose symptoms do not go away with lifestyle changes and medicines. Heartburn and other symptoms should improve after surgery. But you may still need to take drugs for your heartburn.  There are also new therapies for reflux that can be performed through an endoscope (a flexible tube passed through the mouth into the stomach).  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_You will have a pelvic exam. It may show:   - Swelling and redness of the skin of the vulva, in the vagina, and on the cervix   - Dry, white spots on the vaginal wall  - Cracks in the skin of the vulva.   A small amount of the vaginal discharge is examined using a microscope. This is called a wet mount and KOH test.  Sometimes, a culture is taken when the infection does not get better with treatment or comes back many times.  Your health care provider may order other tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your doctor may diagnose your child with achondroplasia while you’re pregnant or after your infant is born.    Diagnosis During Pregnancy  Some characteristics of achondroplasia are detectable during an ultrasound. These include hydrocephalus, or an abnormally large head. If your doctor suspects achondroplasia, genetic tests may be ordered. These tests look for the defective FGFR3 gene in a sample of amniotic fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the womb.    Diagnosis After Your Child Is Born  Your doctor can diagnose your child by looking at his or her features. The doctor may also order X-rays to measure the length of your infant’s bones. This can help confirm a diagnosis. Blood tests may also be ordered to look for the defective FGFR3 gene.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your health care provider can treat a wart if you do not like how it looks or if it is painful.  Do NOT attempt to remove a wart yourself by burning, cutting, tearing, picking, or by any other method.  MEDICINES  Over-the-counter medicines are available to remove warts.   Do NOT use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. Warts in these areas need to be treated by a health care provider.  To use wart-removal medicine:  - File the wart with a nail file or emery board when your skin is damp (for example, after a shower or bath). This helps remove dead tissue. Do not use the same emery board on your nails.  - Put the medicine on the wart every day for several weeks or months. Follow the instructions on the label.  - Cover the wart with a bandage to prevent it from spreading.     OTHER TREATMENTS  Special foot cushions can help ease the pain from plantar warts. You can buy these at drugstores without a prescription. Use socks. Wear shoes with plenty of room. Avoid high heels.  Your health care provider may need to trim away thick skin or calluses that form over warts on your foot or around nails.   Your provider may recommend the following treatments if your warts do not go away:  - Stronger (prescription) medicines  - A blistering solution   - Freezing the wart (cryotherapy) to remove it  - Burning the wart (electrocautery) to remove it  - Laser treatment for difficult to remove warts  - Immunotherapy, which gives you a shot of a substance that causes an allergic reaction and helps the wart go away  - Skin medicine called imiquimod    Genital warts are treated in a different way than most other warts.  A medicine called veregen may be used on genital warts, as well as on other warts.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your provider may recommend that you do the following:      Avoid activities that cause pain.     Put ice on the heel several times a day.     Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.     Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.     Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.   Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.  If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).  If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.  People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder.  Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.  Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected people may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. Medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.

      "   cat__answer_X-linked congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness). They also have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder. The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Researchers have identified two major types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: the complete form and the incomplete form. The types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause and by the results of a test called an electroretinogram, which measures the function of the retina.\\n  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_You can make many lifestyle changes to help treat your symptoms.  Other tips include:  - If you are overweight or obese, in many cases, losing weight can help.  - Avoid drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain.  - Take all of your medicines with plenty of water. When your doctor gives you a new medicine, ask whether it will make your heartburn worse.    You may use over-the-counter antacids after meals and at bedtime, although the relief may not last very long. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation.  Other over-the-counter and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids, but give you longer relief. Your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse can tell you how to take these drugs.  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach  - H2 blockers also lower the amount of acid released in the stomach    Anti-reflux surgery may be an option for people whose symptoms do not go away with lifestyle changes and medicines. Heartburn and other symptoms should improve after surgery. But you may still need to take drugs for your heartburn.  There are also new therapies for reflux that can be performed through an endoscope (a flexible tube passed through the mouth into the stomach).  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_You will have a pelvic exam. It may show:   - Swelling and redness of the skin of the vulva, in the vagina, and on the cervix   - Dry, white spots on the vaginal wall  - Cracks in the skin of the vulva.   A small amount of the vaginal discharge is examined using a microscope. This is called a wet mount and KOH test.  Sometimes, a culture is taken when the infection does not get better with treatment or comes back many times.  Your health care provider may order other tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your doctor may diagnose your child with achondroplasia while you’re pregnant or after your infant is born.    Diagnosis During Pregnancy  Some characteristics of achondroplasia are detectable during an ultrasound. These include hydrocephalus, or an abnormally large head. If your doctor suspects achondroplasia, genetic tests may be ordered. These tests look for the defective FGFR3 gene in a sample of amniotic fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the womb.    Diagnosis After Your Child Is Born  Your doctor can diagnose your child by looking at his or her features. The doctor may also order X-rays to measure the length of your infant’s bones. This can help confirm a diagnosis. Blood tests may also be ordered to look for the defective FGFR3 gene.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your health care provider can treat a wart if you do not like how it looks or if it is painful.  Do NOT attempt to remove a wart yourself by burning, cutting, tearing, picking, or by any other method.  MEDICINES  Over-the-counter medicines are available to remove warts.   Do NOT use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. Warts in these areas need to be treated by a health care provider.  To use wart-removal medicine:  - File the wart with a nail file or emery board when your skin is damp (for example, after a shower or bath). This helps remove dead tissue. Do not use the same emery board on your nails.  - Put the medicine on the wart every day for several weeks or months. Follow the instructions on the label.  - Cover the wart with a bandage to prevent it from spreading.     OTHER TREATMENTS  Special foot cushions can help ease the pain from plantar warts. You can buy these at drugstores without a prescription. Use socks. Wear shoes with plenty of room. Avoid high heels.  Your health care provider may need to trim away thick skin or calluses that form over warts on your foot or around nails.   Your provider may recommend the following treatments if your warts do not go away:  - Stronger (prescription) medicines  - A blistering solution   - Freezing the wart (cryotherapy) to remove it  - Burning the wart (electrocautery) to remove it  - Laser treatment for difficult to remove warts  - Immunotherapy, which gives you a shot of a substance that causes an allergic reaction and helps the wart go away  - Skin medicine called imiquimod    Genital warts are treated in a different way than most other warts.  A medicine called veregen may be used on genital warts, as well as on other warts.  \\\n",

      "   cat__answer_Your provider may recommend that you do the following:      Avoid activities that cause pain.     Put ice on the heel several times a day.     Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.     Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.     Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.   Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.  If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).  If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.  \\\n",
