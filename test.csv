,,achondroplasia research hello we are students from location and we are doing a biology project of genetic diseases we chose achondroplasia as our disease to research we have a few question and we are hoping you could answer them our questions are can you tell if your child will have achondroplasia when you are pregnant when do people usually come in when they think something isnt right with their child what are the worse cases of achondroplasia youve ever seen thank you in advance sincerely name,"[{'focus': 'achondroplasia', 'type': 'diagnosis', 'answer': 'Your doctor may diagnose your child with achondroplasia while you’re pregnant or after your infant is born.    Diagnosis During Pregnancy  Some characteristics of achondroplasia are detectable during an ultrasound. These include hydrocephalus, or an abnormally large head. If your doctor suspects achondroplasia, genetic tests may be ordered. These tests look for the defective FGFR3 gene in a sample of amniotic fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the womb.    Diagnosis After Your Child Is Born  Your doctor can diagnose your child by looking at his or her features. The doctor may also order X-rays to measure the length of your infant’s bones. This can help confirm a diagnosis. Blood tests may also be ordered to look for the defective FGFR3 gene.'}, {'focus': 'achondroplasia', 'type': 'prognosis', 'answer': 'People with achondroplasia seldom reach 5 feet in height. Intelligence is in the normal range. Infants who receive the abnormal gene from both parents do not often live beyond a few months.'}]"

This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:  - Eating more food than your body can use  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Not getting enough exercise    Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.  Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally.   The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.   The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.   We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.   - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.  - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.  - People with little free time may have less time to exercise.    The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.  Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:  - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)  - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics    Other things that can cause weight gain are:  - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting.  - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well  - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause.  - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy.'}, {'focus': 'obesity', 'type': 'treatment', 'answer': 'CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE   An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch'}]"
,Kidney Stone,hello drin a case of patient with kidney stone size of 12mm x 23mm what can i do pls i need your advice,"[{'focus': 'kidney stone', 'type': 'treatment', 'answer': 'Treatment depends on the type of stone and the severity of your symptoms.  Kidney stones that are small most often pass through your system on their own.   - Your urine should be strained so the stone can be saved and tested.  - Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine. This will help the stone pass.  - Pain can be very bad. Over-the-counter pain medicines (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen), either alone or along with narcotics, can be very effective.    Some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital. You may need to get fluids through a vein.  For some types of stones, your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help break down and remove the material that is causing the stone. These medicines can include:  - Allopurinol (for uric acid stones)  - Antibiotics (for struvite stones)  - Diuretics  - Phosphate solutions  - Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate  - Water pills (thiazide diuretics)  - Tamsulosin to relax the ureter and help the stone pass    Surgery is often needed if:  - The stone is too large to pass on its own  - The stone is growing  - The stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage  - The pain cannot be controlled     Today, most treatments are much less invasive than in the past.  - Lithotripsy is used to remove stones slightly smaller than a half an inch that are located in the kidney or ureter. It uses sound or shock waves to break up stones. Then, the stone fragments leave the body in the urine. It is also called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or ESWL.  - Procedures performed by passing a special instrument through a small surgical cut in your skin and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones, or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed. The stone is removed with a tube (endoscope).  - Ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract.  - Rarely, open surgery (nephrolithotomy) may be needed if other methods do not work or are not possible.    Talk to your provider about what treatment options may work for you.'}]"
,,customer service request my daughter has turner syndrome but shes beaten all odds she developed on our own got her period on her own she is now pregnant on her own with identical twins my question is can she have normal children or do they have more of a chance of having turner syndrome my daughter has been tested many times to confirm her diagnosis of turner syndrome and she is a full xo not mosaic but still does not display many of the characteristics again i am just questioning the safety of the pregnancy and the health of the babies thank you for your help,"[{'focus': 'turner syndrome', 'type': 'inheritance', 'answer': 'Most cases of Turner syndrome are not inherited. Most commonly, Turner syndrome occurs due to a random event during the formation of an egg or sperm cell in a parent (prior to conception). For example, if an egg or sperm cell mistakenly loses a sex chromosome, and joins at conception with an egg or sperm containing an X chromosome, the resulting child will have a single X chromosome in each cell. Mosaic Turner syndrome, occurring when a person has some cells with one X chromosome and some cells with two sex chromosomes, is also not inherited. This also occurs due to a random event, during early fetal development rather than before conception. In rare cases, Turner syndrome may be caused by a missing piece (partial deletion) of the X chromosome. A deletion can be inherited from a parent. Genetic testing of an affected fetus or child can identify the type of Turner syndrome present and may help to estimate the risk of recurrence. People with questions about genetic testing or recurrence risks for Turner syndrome are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional.'}]"

,Stroke Due to Aneurysm?,my son had a hemmorhagic stroke at 4 weeks of agehe is now 31 years old in the week leading up to the stroke he had a head cold and i had been giving him infant cold drops after he had the stroke the doctors at the time could only say that it was a fluke and would probably never happen again the reason for the stroke has haunted me ever since now we just recently found out that my mother has a cerebral aneurysm and they say this can be hereditary so my question now is did my son have an aneurysm that burst or was it caused by a blood clotis there anyway of knowing or getting an answer to that question after the event has happened,"[{'focus': 'stroke', 'type': 'cause', 'answer': 'There are two major types of stroke:   - Ischemic stroke  - Hemorrhagic stroke    Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways:   - A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke.  - A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.    Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.       Watch this video about:   Stroke         Watch this video about:   Stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism     A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:   - Aneurysm  - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)    Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin). Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke.   An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke.  High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are:  - Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation  - Diabetes  - Family history of stroke  - High cholesterol  - Increasing age, especially after age 55  - Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke)        Watch this video about:   Hypertension - overview     Stroke risk is also higher in:   - People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries  - People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and lack of exercise  - Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35)  - Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant  - Women who take hormone replacement therapy'}]"
,help,i have back pain please help,"[{'focus': 'back pain', 'type': 'treatment', 'answer': 'Most low back pain can be treated without surgery. Treatment involves using over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce discomfort and anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation. The goal of treatment is to restore proper function and strength to the back, and prevent recurrence of the injury. Medications are often used to treat acute and chronic low back pain. Effective pain relief may involve a combination of prescription drugs and over-the-counter remedies. Although the use of cold and hot compresses has never been scientifically proven to quickly resolve low back injury, compresses may help reduce pain and inflammation and allow greater mobility for some individuals. Bed rest is recommended for only 1–2 days at most. Individuals should resume activities as soon as possible. Exercise may be the most effective way to speed recovery from low back pain and help strengthen back and abdominal muscles. In the most serious cases, when the condition does not respond to other therapies, surgery may relieve pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries.'}]"
,,can u please send stuff on fibromyalgia as well,"[{'focus': 'fibromyalgia', 'type': 'information', 'answer': 'Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome in which a person has long-term pain, spread throughout the body. The pain is most often linked to fatigue, sleep problems, headaches, depression, and anxiety.  People with fibromalgia may also have tenderness in the joints, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues.'}]"
,father suffering from IBS,my father is suffering from ibs and is loosing weight day by daysometimes he even faints due to weaknesshe cannot digest food please help us and suggest us upon this problem,"[{'focus': 'ibs', 'type': 'treatment', 'answer': 'The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms.   In some cases of IBS, lifestyle changes can help. For example, regular exercise and improved sleep habits may reduce anxiety and help relieve bowel symptoms.  Dietary changes can be helpful. However, no specific diet can be recommended for IBS because the condition differs from one person to another.  The following changes may help:  - Avoiding foods and drinks that stimulate the intestines (such as caffeine, tea, or colas)  - Eating smaller meals  - Increasing fiber in the diet (this may improve constipation or diarrhea, but make bloating worse)    Talk with your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines.  No one medicine works for everyone. Some that your provider may suggest include:  - Anticholinergic medicines (dicyclomine, propantheline, belladonna, and hyoscyamine) taken about a half-hour before eating to control intestinal muscle spasms  - Bisacodyl to treat constipation  - Loperamide to treat diarrhea  - Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants to help relieve intestinal pain  - Lubiprostone for constipation symptoms  - Rifaximin, an antibiotic    Psychological therapy or medicines for anxiety or depression may help with the problem.'}]"
,,kartageners syndrome i am suffering from kartageners syndrome and wanted information from you or from dr name for this syndrome about fertility and if possible other symptoms thank you,"[{'focus': ""kartagener's syndrome"", 'type': 'information', 'answer': 'Kartagener syndrome is a type of primary ciliary dyskinesia that is also characterized by situs inversus totalis (mirror-image reversal of internal organs). The signs and symptoms vary but may include neonatal respiratory distress; frequent lung, sinus and middle ear infections beginning in early childhood; and infertility.[1][2][3] It can be cause by changes (mutations) in many different genes that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although scientists have identified many of the genes associated with Kartagener syndrome, the genetic cause of some cases is unknown.[4][2] There is no cure for Kartagener syndrome. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include airway clearance therapy and antibiotics.[1][2][3]'}]"
,,breast cancer at 84 my mother was just diagnost with breast cancer she is 84 years old her tumor started in the milk duct and is small in size their is a mass as well in the same breast he is scheduled for a lumpectomy to remove both because of age we would like suggestions on treatment options after surgery,"[{'focus': 'breast cancer', 'type': 'treatment', 'answer': 'Treatment is based on many factors, including:  - Type and stage of the cancer  - Whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones  - Whether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses) the HER2/neu gene    Cancer treatments may include:  - Chemotherapy, which uses medicines to kill cancer cells.  - Radiation therapy, which is used to destroy cancerous tissue.  - Surgery to remove cancerous tissue: A lumpectomy removes the breast lump; mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possibly nearby structures.  - Targeted therapy uses medicine to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth.     Cancer treatment can be local or systemic:  - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.  - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.    Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (curing). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.  - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment.  - Stage I and II -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery.  - Stage III -- Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy.  - Stage IV -- Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.    After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment.  Women who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later.'}]"
,Louis Bar Syndrome,my brother died young from louis bar syndrome of six pregnancies four children either did not survive pregnancy or died very young i would like to know is it possible that other children like me could have the syndrome symptoms to a lesser or greater degreeie is there a continuum,"[{'focus': 'louis bar syndrome', 'type': 'inheritance', 'answer': 'Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the ATM gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  About 1 percent of the United States population carries one mutated copy and one normal copy of the ATM gene in each cell. These individuals are called carriers. Although ATM mutation carriers do not have ataxia-telangiectasia, they are more likely than people without an ATM mutation to develop cancer; female carriers are particularly at risk for developing breast cancer. Carriers of a mutation in the ATM gene also may have an increased risk of heart disease.'}]"
,allopurinol and diuretics,i am presently taking 200mg allopurinol daily for the treatment of gout my feet swell how dangerous is it to take a diuretic,"[{'focus': 'allopurinol', 'type': 'interaction', 'answer': ""Before taking allopurinol,      tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to allopurinol or any other medications.     tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Be sure to mention any of the following: amoxicillin (Amoxil, Trimox); ampicillin (Polycillin, Principen); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); cancer chemotherapy drugs such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol); chlorpropamide (Diabinese); diuretics ('water pills'); medications that suppress the immune system such as azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune); other medications for gout such as probenecid (Benemid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane); and tolbutamide (Orinase). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.     tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease or heart failure.     tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking allopurinol, call your doctor.     you should know that allopurinol may make you drowsy.

The tumors are thought to grow from specialized cells found in the gastrointestinal tract called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or precursors to these cells. GISTs are usually found in adults between ages 40 and 70; rarely, children and young adults develop these tumors. The tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).  Small tumors may cause no signs or symptoms. However, some people with GISTs may experience pain or swelling in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or weight loss. Sometimes, tumors cause bleeding, which may lead to low red blood cell counts (anemia) and, consequently, weakness and tiredness. Bleeding into the intestinal tract may cause black and tarry stools, and bleeding into the throat or stomach may cause vomiting of blood.  Affected individuals with no family history of GIST typically have only one tumor (called a sporadic GIST). People with a family history of GISTs (called familial GISTs) often have multiple tumors and additional signs or symptoms, including noncancerous overgrowth (hyperplasia) of other cells in the gastrointestinal tract and patches of dark skin on various areas of the body.

It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.  A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:   - Having sex at an early age  - Having multiple sexual partners  - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities    Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:  - Not getting the HPV vaccine  - Being economically disadvantaged  - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage  - Having a weakened immune system""}]"

The urinary problems associated with Ochoa syndrome typically become apparent in early childhood or adolescence. People with this disorder may have difficulty controlling the flow of urine (incontinence), which can lead to bedwetting. Individuals with Ochoa syndrome may be unable to completely empty the bladder, often resulting in vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine backs up into the ducts that normally carry it from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters). Urine may also accumulate in the kidneys (hydronephrosis). Vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis can lead to frequent infections of the urinary tract and kidney inflammation (pyelonephritis), causing damage that may eventually result in kidney failure.  Individuals with Ochoa syndrome also exhibit a characteristic frown-like facial grimace when they try to smile or laugh, often described as inversion of facial expression. While this feature may appear earlier than the urinary tract symptoms, perhaps as early as an infant begins to smile, it is often not brought to medical attention.  Approximately two-thirds of individuals with Ochoa syndrome also experience problems with bowel function, such as constipation, loss of bowel control, or muscle spasms of the anus.'}]"

The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.   A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.  If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:  - Antidepressants  - Blood pressure medicines  - Seizure medicines    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.  Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium are right for you.  TREATING AN ATTACK  Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:   - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.  - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.  - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.    If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.   Feverfew is a herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people.

Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions.

Antibiotics are first given by IV.  - Never treat yourself without being seen by your doctor first. Your health care provider will determine the best treatment.    About half of the women with gonorrhea are also infected with chlamydia. Chlamydia is treated at the same time as a gonorrhea infection.  You will need a follow-up visit 7 days after if your symptoms include joint pain, skin rash, or more severe pelvic or belly pain. Tests will be done to make sure the infection is gone.  Sexual partners must be tested and treated to prevent passing the infection back and forth. You and your partner must finish all of the antibiotics. Use condoms until you both have finished taking your antibiotics.  All sexual contacts of the person with gonorrhea should be contacted and tested. This helps prevent further spread of the infection.  - In some places you may be able to take information and medicines to your sexual partner yourself.  - In other places, the health department will contact your partner.'}]"

,,i would appreciate it if you can send me or email me some exercises for a person who is a stroke victim i am unable to walk due to a arthritic knee otherwise i am flexable my home address is contact my email is contact mailtocontact thank you name,"[{'focus': 'stroke', 'type': 'treatment', 'answer': 'A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home.'}]"
